## Introduction
This is the third project for my Udacity Nanodegree program. This application is a mobile flash card application that helps users practice quiz exercises and receive scores as well as notifications to study using the app.It consists majorly of  7 pages. The app allows the user to create a deck and add cards to that deck. It also allows the user to take quiz exercises.

## Mode of usage
On the main page, Click on the button to load the list of decks. Clicking on one of the decks should lead to viewing details of that deck.
